Welcome to SpreadJava!
===================


Hey! I'm the owner and first contributor for the #ShareJava Campaign. As part of the ground rules, certain rules would be put in place to ensure the consistency and standard of the source codes. 

If you are a first timer, fret not - I have a dedicated guide for you to adhere by and follow thoughout. And if you are feeling confused, **create an Issue** and/or **tweet me up** and/or **shoutout in our slack**. 

----------


Is this Your First Time?
-------------

Firstly, you need to get started with cloning our Repository onto your IDE. Do follow the following to get started.

> **Note:**

> - Access the appopriate repo you wish to clone from.
> - Obtain the HTTPS URL from **Clone from URL** and import from Git into your IDE
> - After synchronizing your local environment with our repository, proceed to make any changes.

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Modifying the Code

Proceed to make any changes in the code by appending comments as when required.

#### <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> Creating a new issue

Before you update the codes with your updated changes, create a new issue under the **Issues** tab to address the functional changes you are making. 

#### <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> Creating a new branch

After creating a new issue for the changes, create a separate branch with the appropriate comments which you worked on. 

Comments convention should be containing the following: 
**Addressing #number_of_Issue issue: description_of_issue**

Naming convention for the new branch: 
**linkedlist-NumberID_of_Issue**

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Committing your Changes

Upon creating the new Branch, commit the new Branch to the repository. And then push the branch.

#### <i class="icon-trash"></i> Compare & pull request

You may proceed to raise a **Pull Request** for the master of the repository to merge into master branch.

#### <i class="icon-hdd"></i> Closure of Issues

After the issue is being merged and addressed, proceed to close the issues accordingly. 

> **Tip:** Do set the milestones on Issues Tab or update on Issues Tab whenever help is required.

For Experienced Amateurs
